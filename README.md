# Flask Python Quick Start
The Flask Python quick start project launches a page app with content from Prepr.


## Set up the project locally

Open the terminal and set up a quick virtual environment like the following:

```
python3 -m venv venv;
. venv/bin/activate;
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Now, you're ready to install dependencies for your project with pip:

```
pip install flask requests
```


You've now installed Flask, a microframework that you'll use for the simple web app to wrap data sent from the GraphQL API.
